# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Analysis of the employee retirement at Pewlett-Hackard

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to first identify the soon to retire employees by title, and to then use this data to determine which employees are also eligable for mentoring positions. 

## Analysis
* The Senior Engineer and Senior Staff titles will be losing the most employees to retirment by far.
[]
* This means that these departments will be needing the most replacement employees in the coming months that staff is retiring. 
* Using the mentorship_eligibility.csv file we can see though that many of these retiring employees can actually be very helpful in mentoring new employees to fill these coming vacancies. 
* Many of these retiring employees have also been members of the company for many years and would make excelent mentors for filling these positions, while also being on the payrole already, removing any need to hire outside assistance for this mentorship. 

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* As shown in this table, 72,458 positions will need to be by the end of this retirment wave. 
[]

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
* As seen here in this section of the mentorship eligibility table, there are over 1,500 eligable mentors, who should ensure that the new generation can be prepared.
